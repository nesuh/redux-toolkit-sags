                   # Redux-Saga Users Fetch Example
This project is a simple React application that demonstrates how to use Redux-Saga to handle side effects, such as fetching data from an API. The application fetches a list of users from an external API and displays them in the UI.

Features
Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous operations.
Redux for state management.
Fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

Code Explanation
Redux-Saga: The saga watches for the GET_USERS_FETCH action and triggers the workGetUsersFetch generator function, which performs the API call and dispatches the GET_USERS_SUCCESS action with the fetched users.
Redux: Manages the state of the users and integrates seamlessly with Redux-Saga for handling side effects.
